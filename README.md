# atmo.rsvp

Events for the open social web, built on AT Protocol.

https://atmo.rsvp

Uses `community.lexicon.calendar.event` and `community.lexicon.calendar.rsvp`.
Create events, RSVP, subscribe to calendars, share previews and see what people
you follow are attending.

## Development

```sh
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
pnpm --filter web env:setup-dev
pnpm dev
```

D1 runs locally by default. Optionally fetch events with `pnpm --filter web backfill`.
Run `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` to validate changes.
See [development notes](docs/development.md) and [operations](docs/operations.md) for details.
