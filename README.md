## development

Requires Node.js **22.17+** and the pinned pnpm version in `package.json`.

```sh
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
pnpm --filter web env:setup-dev
pnpm dev
```

D1 runs locally by default. Optionally fetch events with `pnpm --filter web backfill`.
Run `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` to validate changes.
See [development notes](docs/development.md) for UI work, optional search, caching, and pagination.
